    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<article>
<p>This is my second project for SDI here at Full Sail.</p>
<p>In honor of my son's birthday (Oct. 5th) I have made the story about him. The story revolves around a heroic monster slayer and the monsters he fights.</p>
<p>This project introduces new concepts including loops, arrays, and functions and is meant to teach us to utilize advanced JavaScript coding.</p>
