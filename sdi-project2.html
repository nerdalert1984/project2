<article>
<p>This is my second project for SDI here at Full Sail. I decided to go in a different direction storywise this round. The story here centers on catching up on reading comic books. The variables have to do with the names of the comics and quantity of issues that I need to read.</p>
<p>This project introduces new concepts including loops, arrays, and functions and is meant to teach us to utilize advanced JavaScript coding.</p>
