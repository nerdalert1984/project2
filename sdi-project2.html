<article>
<p>This is my second project for SDI here at Full Sail. I decided to go in a different direction storywise this round.</p>
<p>The story here centers on catching up on reading comic books. The variables have to do with the names of the comics and quantity of issues </p>
<p>that I need to read.</p>
